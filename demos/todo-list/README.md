## Todo List demo

This project takes the ["Todo List" example from Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/example) and wraps the Redux state
in `atomFromReduxState` so that it can be interacted with via Recoil.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[See the original readme here](./create-react-app.md).
