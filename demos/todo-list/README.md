## Todo List demo

This project takes the ["Todo List" example from Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/example) and implements it in three
ways:

1. Using the standard Redux store
2. Using equivalent state in Recoil
3. Using React-to-Recoil to create Recoil state using the original Redux code

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
